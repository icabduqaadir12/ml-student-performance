# ML Student Performance Analysis

## Phase 1 – Machine Learning Foundations

This project is part of a structured learning journey to understand machine learning fundamentals through real-world datasets.

## Project Objective
To explore and understand student-related data and prepare it for building machine learning models that can predict student performance.

## Phase 1 – Day 1 Work
- Loaded the student performance dataset
- Inspected dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
- Checked for missing values
- Generated basic statistics
- Identified potential target variables for prediction

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Next Steps
- Clean the dataset
- Handle missing values
- Prepare features for machine learning models
